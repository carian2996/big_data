## Overview of Final Project Design

Throughout the weeks of this capstone, you will be guided in preparing a final capstone project which you will submit for peer review in week 6. The project submission, designed in conjunction with Splunk, will have 2 main parts:

1. **A presentation slide deck with an accompanying written script** - targeting a 10 minute talk to high-level company executives at Eglence, Inc. This presentation will give a very high-level overview of findings from your analysis. However, we aren't asking you to present it (video can be hard to review and is challenging for non-native English speakers). We are asking you to write a slide-by-slide script of what you would say -- targeting a <10 minute presentation. You may want to go ahead and have a look at the template slides you are to fill in. See the comments field for advice on what to present and what to talk about for each slide. You may [click to download a Google Slide Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OO82dc8Mv0rPeml3ZdVnIXF3IUXWpiS4XZ9nUA-Ems8/edit?usp=sharing) to get started.

2. A written technical appendix - for further detail on the analysis done. You will be guided in creating this technical appendix as you go through the data preparation and analysis tasks each week. You will have the opportunity to clarify and improve your technical appendix through Peer Review each week, so that at the end of the capstone, you should have a clear and thorough document outlining the data preparation and analysis you performed.

We hope that this project submission format will not only allow you to practice and document the skills and techniques you learned in this specialization, but also to serve as something you can include in an online portfolio or take with you to a job interview to discuss what you learned in your Big Data specialization on Coursera!
