# UC San Diego: Big Data, Version 1 Specialization
I gained an understanding of what insights big data can provide through hands-on experience with the tools and systems used by big data scientists and engineers. 

During this specialization I learned: 
- Basics of using Hadoop with MapReduce, Spark, Pig and Hive. 
- Perform **predictive modeling** and leverage **graph analytics** to model problems. 
- Ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large, complex datasets. 

In the final Capstone Project, I applied my skills to do basic analyses of big data. You can check the work for this capstone project here: https://github.com/carian2996/big_data/tree/master/capstone_project.

Major technologies used: 
1. PySpark
2. Pandas
3. Neo4j
4. Splunk
